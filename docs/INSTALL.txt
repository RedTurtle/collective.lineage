collective.lineage Installation
==========================


Here is an example buildout.cfg. Please note the plip234 branches. You *will* need these for Lineage to work until Plone 3.3 releases. 


[buildout]
parts =
  zope2
  instance
  zopepy
	plip234-branches
find-links =
  http://chef:eet1OhFoo@skillet.sixfeetup.com/simple

[plip234-branches]
recipe = infrae.subversion
location = plip234-branches
as_eggs = true
urls =
	http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/Plone/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes Plone
	http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.layout/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes plone.app.layout
	http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.portlets/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes plone.app.portlets

[zope2]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install
url = http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.10.6/Zope-2.10.6-final.tgz
fake-zope-eggs = true
additional-fake-eggs =
  ZConfig
  pytz

[instance]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
zope2-location = ${zope2:location}
user = admin:admin
debug-mode = on
verbose-security = on
# If you want Zope to know about any additional eggs or register extra
# ZCML slugs for any packages, please list them here.  Please note that
# any development eggs you listed in develop-eggs above should get
# automatically pulled in by `buildout.eggtractor`, though.
# Examples:
#   eggs = Plone my.package
#   zcml = my.package
eggs =
	Plone
	collective.lineage
zcml =
	collective.lineage

[zopepy]
recipe = zc.recipe.egg
eggs = ${instance:eggs}
interpreter = zopepy
extra-paths = ${zope2:location}/lib/python
scripts = zopepy






If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``collective.lineage`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.lineage
        
  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.lineage
        
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file
